## Overview

Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify customers likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies. This project uses Python and popular ML libraries to build and evaluate predictive models.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains customer information such as demographics, account details, and service usage.
- Ensure the dataset is placed in the project directory as specified in the notebook.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Projects.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb
    ```
2. Run each cell sequentially to:
    - Load and preprocess data
    - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    - Engineer features
    - Train and evaluate models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
    - Interpret results

## Results

- The best-performing model achieved high accuracy and recall on the test set.
- Feature importance analysis highlights key drivers of churn.
