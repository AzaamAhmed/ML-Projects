## Dataset

- Includes customer demographics, account information, service usage patterns, and churn labels.
- Ensure the dataset file is placed in the project directory as specified in the notebook.
- Example columns: `CustomerID`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Tenure`, `ContractType`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`, `Services`, `Churn`, etc.
- Data privacy and anonymization best practices are followed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Projects.git
    cd "ML-Projects/Customer Churn Prediction"
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb
    ```
2. **Follow the notebook steps to:**
    - Load and preprocess the data
    - Perform EDA with insightful plots and statistics
    - Engineer and select relevant features
    - Train and evaluate multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
    - Tune hyperparameters for optimal results
    - Interpret results and visualize feature importance using SHAP and other tools

## Results

- The best-performing model achieved strong accuracy and recall on the test set, demonstrating reliable churn prediction capabilities.
- Feature importance and SHAP analysis highlighted key churn drivers, such as contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and service usage.
- Visualizations and dashboards provide actionable insights for business stakeholders to inform retention strategies.
