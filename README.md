## 📁 Project Structure

Each project has its own directory and includes:

- `README.md` – Explanation of the project
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter or Colab notebooks
- `src/` – Python scripts (if applicable)
- `data/` – Sample or processed datasets
- `models/` – Trained model files (if applicable)
- `requirements.txt` – Required Python libraries (optional)
